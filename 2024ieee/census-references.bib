@article{traore2017introduction,
	annote = {Definition 1.-- A computational framework is a set of concepts, properties, rules and tools that can be of a theoretical, methodological, technical or technological nature, which are glued in a normative architecture, to ease and possibly automate the problem-solving process partly or entirely.

Definition 2.-- CSE deals with the development and application of computational frameworks to solve complex problems.

Computational Science and Engineering (CSE) is core to all engineering sciences. As a result, computational systems are seeing an explosion growth of services to all user domains worldwide: public or private, military or governmental, educational or industry, healthcare or finance and science or entertainment. Beyond their diversity, there is a unity of concerns, which can be expressed through some key research questions. The use of computational technologies (e.g. high performance clusters, Big Data, databases and information systems, integrated and embedded hardware/software components, smart devices, mobile and pervasive networks, cyber physical systems, etc.) requires theoretical, methodological, technical, scaling and many other important issues to be studied, monitored and predicted in order to save costs and time and to add value to social capital.

CSE is a relatively new discipline, commonly heralded as the third mode of discovery (next to theory and experimentation) [ODE 14], [RAY 11]. Computational science is often described as fusing numerical methods (with a special focus on Modeling & Simulation (M&S)), computer systems (software and hardware, with a special focus on High Performance Computing) and information science (with a special focus on data management). Today, it is an essential component of modern research in different areas (computational physics, computational biology, computational chemistry, etc.) where it often bridges computer science, mathematics and domain-specific knowledge. It calls for the use of some computational approach that may also require the design of the supporting computational system or the use of an existing one. This is where computational frameworks come into play.

In all forms of CSE, there is a common barrier to the design and use of computational systems, which we call the heterogeneity challenge. Indeed, computational approaches are confronted to a universal complexity due to the need to integrate heterogeneous components into a homogeneous whole (i.e. the framework). Such heterogeneity can take at least one of the following forms:

    --

    disparity of abstractions (often referred to as multiabstraction or multilevel) [BEN 98];
    --

    diversity of details (often referred to as multiresolution) [DAV 93];
    --

    variety of scales (often referred to as multiscale) [TAO 09];
    --

    multiplicity of perspectives (often referred to as multiview or multiperspective) [REI 14];
    --

    distribution of geographic locations (often referred to as multisite) [YAN 08].

From the literature, we can also derive the following four key requirements to overcome this barrier:

    --

    a system-theoretic approach is needed for a deep and structured understanding of the phenomena involved. ;
--

a holistic approach is necessary for a sound cognitive management of the system or the SoS identified. ;
--

validity is always a critical (and often non-trivial) issue. ;
--

it is increasingly compulsory to use performant infrastructures to support computations as they are getting heavier with new areas and demands of CSE
