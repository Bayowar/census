This research analysis aims to develop novel automated reasoning techniques that incorporate contextual probability to analyze complex, real-world community data in relation to historically Black communities and communities of color. By focusing on census data and changes at the community level from 2005 to 2020, we create a series of proof-based implementations in various quantitative databases.

We design a novel framework that extends traditional automated reasoning techniques to incorporate contextual probability. This framework will allow for more nuanced analysis of real-world data by considering the context in which probabilities are calculated and applied.

Our team develops a series of proof-based algorithms specifically tailored for analyzing community data over time. These algorithms leverage the contextual probability framework to identify trends, anomalies, and causal relationships within the data.

# Contextual probabilities

We defined contextual probability based on the work of Wang (2001).

# Model

Let's $D_t$ be the diversity index of a community at time $t$. Let $p_{i, t}$ be the proportion of individuals belonging to group $i$ at time $t$. Let $n$ be the total number of distinct neighborhood groups in the community.

# Theorem

The change in community diversity $\Delta D$ between two time points $t_1$ and $t_2$ can be expressed as a function of the changes in group proportions, weighted by their contextual probabilites.

# Proof

1. We define the diversity index using the Shannon entropy formula as $$ D_t = - \sum_{i=1} p_{i, t} log(p_{i}, t)$$

2. The change in diversity $\Delta D$ between $t_1$ and $t_2$ is: $$ \Delta D = D_{t_{2}} - D_{t_{1}} = - \sum{i=1} p_{i, t} log(p_{i}, t_1) + p_{i, t} log(p_{i}, t_2)$$

3. Let $C_i$ be the contextual probabilty of change for group $i$, based on historical trends and local factors as discussed in the literature review on anti-blackness and diversity.

4. We can express the change in proportions for each group as: $$ \Delta p_i = p_{i, t_2} - p_{i, t_1} = C_i \times f(t_2 - t_1)$$

5. Substituting this into our diversity index change equation: $$ \Delta D = - \sum_{i= 1} (p_{i, t_1} + C_i \times f(t_2 - t_1)) log(p_{i, t_1} + C_i \times f(t_2 - t_1)) + \sum_{i=1} p_{i, t_1} log(p_i, t_1)$$

6.This equation allows us to calculate the change in diversity as a function of initial proportions, contextual probabilities, and time difference.  

# Case studies

We examine three cases in Washington, DC, Oakland, CA, and  Charlotte, NC.

# Discussion

This proof demonstrates how contextual probabilities can be incorporated into the analysis of community diversity changes over time. By using census data to estimate $p_{i,t}$ and historical trends to determine $C_i$, we can predict and analyze community changes more accurately.
